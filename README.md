A *production-ready* image for Odoo SAAS-6 Upstream 
===================================================

This image weighs just over 1Gb. Keep in mind that Odoo is a very extensive suite of business applications written in Python. We designed this image with built-in external dependencies and almost nothing useless. It is used from development to production on version SAAS-6 with various community addons.

Odoo version
============

This docker builds with a upstream version of Odoo (formerly OpenERP) AND related dependencies. We intend to follow the git.

You may use your own sources simply by binding your local Odoo folder to /opt/odoo/sources/odoo/

Here are the current revisions from https://github.com/odoo/odoo/archive/saas-6.tar.gz for each docker tag
